    <h3>Welcome to Sell Order Pre trade registration</h3>
     <p>With shortage of commodity, the buyer and sellers will illegally approach for bribing and get 
        sellers order and buyer would have the privilege to get the sell order and bid for it for
        successful trade execution. On the other hand those buyers who have not approach sellers 
        would not get the opportunity to be successful</p>
    <p>Hence, the exchange  intend to provide lenient sell order information for all 
        buyer traders so that the abusive use of seller-buyer communication could be
         mitigated or avoided so that the exchange  trade should be leaded by market interest and information.</p>
